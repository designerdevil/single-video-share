# Simple Redux Boilerplate
Simple architecture for react using redux

### How it works?
This works with three principles of Redux.
- state tree is immutable
- state is readonly and the only way to change is, by dispatching actions
- without changing the previous state a new state is returned with a pure function, called as reducer.

### How to test the source?

To run

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

To deploy

```sh
$ npm run deploy
```
